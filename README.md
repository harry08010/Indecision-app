# Indecision-app
A react playground app

This is the first project of Udemy course "Complete React Web Development 2nd Edition". Just finished it and anyone interested in feels free to play with it!

To run this project, run:

```
yarn run dev-server
```
*Note: a series of node modules are required to run, dependencies are included in package.json*

and go to localhost:8080.
